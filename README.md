# c_algorihtms_ds
Cannonical Algorithms and Data Structures in several languages, mainly C and Python and probably Java.
This is mainly for personal use; a kind of reservoire of implementations I find useful or inttuitive for learning and reviewing topics I alredy know.
In the future, this might include my solutions and answers to puzzles.
Most of these implementations comes from online resources like geeksforgeeks.com, moocs.. etc.
